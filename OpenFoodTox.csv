Alternaria toxins belong to 5 different classes (1) dibenzo-alpha-pyrones which include alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME) and altenuene (ALT); (2) tenuazonic acid (TeA); (3) perylene quinones which include altertoxins (ATX); (4) Alternaria alternata f. sp. lycopersici toxins (AAL-toxins) and (5) miscellaneous structures such as tentoxin (TEN).",10682,RF-00000190-TOX,Alternaria toxins,"group, closed",8,QU08A,part of group assessment,,Iso-tenuazonic acid,,,,22168,RF-00007559-PAR,iso-tenuazonic acid,C10H15NO3,OC1=C(C(=O)N[C@H]1CC(C)C)C(=O)C,,organic,,,

These glycans are characterized by alpha-1,3-linked galactose residues at the terminal non-reducing position. Unlike human lactoferrin, bLF also contains glycans of the oligomannosidic type.

The anthocyanins/anthocyanidins class consists of some 500 or more compounds. The structural variations of anthocyanins are due to differences in the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule, the degree of methylation of these hydroxyl groups, the nature and number of the sugar moiety attached to the phenolic (aglycone) molecule and the position of the attachment, as well as the nature and number of aliphatic or aromatic acids attached to the sugars. Anthocyanins most frequently occur as 3-monosides, 3-biosides and 3-triosides as well as 3,5-diglycosides and more rarely 3,7-diglycosides associated with the sugars glucose < rhamnose < galactose < xylose < arabinose.",14260,RF-00000044-ADD,Anthocyanins,complex product: derived from botanical sources,15,QU15A,maybe part of,,Delphinidin,208-437-0,528-53-0,"2-(3,4,5-Trihydroxyphenyl)chromenylium-3,5,7-triol;chloride",23870,RF-00009251-PAR,Delphinidin,C15H11ClO7,C1=C(C=C(C(=C1O)O)O)C2=C(C=C3C(=CC(=CC3=[O+]2)O)O)O.[Cl-],"InChI=1S/C15H10O7.ClH/c16-7-3-9(17)8-5-12(20)15(22-13(8)4-7)6-1-10(18)14(21)11(19)2-6;/h1-5H,(H5-,16,17,18,19,20,21);1H",organic,,,

It originated in Central America but is now widely grown in many tropical and sub-tropical countries, predominantly as a source of seed oil that is increasingly usedfor biodiesel production. Following oil extraction from the seeds, the remaining cakes or meals have a high protein content (approximately 60-65% in the case of kernel meal), making them potentially valuable as an animal feed ingredient. Untreated Jatropha kernel meal contains, however, toxic phorbol esters (PEs)in concentrations varying between 600 and 700 mg/kg fresh weight (FW) and also anti-nutritional substances, making it -and products derived from it- unsuitable for use as a feed ingredient. Non-toxic genotypes of Jatrophahave been identified, but their distribution is restricted to limited regions in Central America and they are not used for oil extraction for biodiesel production or as a feed material.",24423,RF-00009802-PAR,Phorbol esters in Jatropha kernel meal,complex product: derived from botanical sources,14,QU14A,part of,,Jatropha phorbol esters,,,,24204,RF-00009583-PAR,Jatropha phorbol esters,,,,organic,,,

It consists chiefly of the potassium, sodium, magnesium and calcium sulphate esters of galactose and 3,6-anhydrogalactose polysaccharides. These hexoses are alternately linked alpha-1,3 and beta-1,4 in the copolymer. The prevalent polysaccharides in carrageenan are designated as iota, lambda, kappa depending on the number of sulphate by repeating unit (i.e. 1,2,3 sulphate). Between iota and lambda there is a continuum of intermediate compositions differing in number of sulphates per repeat units between 1 and 2. During the process, no organic precipitant shall be used other than methanol, ethanol and propan-2-ol. The wording �carrageenan� is reserved for the non-hydrolysed or otherwise chemically degraded polymer. Formaldehyde may be present as an adventitious impurity up to a maximum of 5 mg/kg (According to the Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/20121). Three major types of carrageenan can be distinguished by the number and position of the sulfate groups on the disaccharide repeating unit (Marburger, 2003; Draeger et al., 2011): 1) iota-carrageenan with one sulfate group at C4 of the beta-D-galactose, 2) lambda-carrageenan with one sulfate group at C4 of the beta-D-galactose and one sulfate group at C2 of the alpha-3,6-anhydro-D-galactose, and 3) kappa-carrageenan with one sulfate group at C2 of the beta-D-galactose and two sulfate groups at C2 and C6 of the alpha-D-galactose. The names iota, lambda- and kappa-carrageenan do not reflect definitive chemical structures but only general differences in the composition and degree of sulfation at specific locations in the polymer (JECFA, 2001).",14300,RF-00000098-ADD,Carrageenan,complex product: derived from botanical sources,7,QU07A,as such,,Carrageenan,232-524-2,9000-07-1,,14300,RF-00000098-ADD,Carrageenan,,,,organic,,,

Description: clear liquids or waxy white flakes, beads or solids having a bland odour. Propane-1,2-diol esters of fatty acids (E 477) is typically dispersible in hot water, but not in cold water and is soluble in edible oils and fats (EFEMA, 2009). According to the JECFA specifications, propane-1,2-diol esters of fatty acids are insoluble in water (JECFA, 2006). Commercial, distilled propane-1,2-diol esters of fatty acids (E 477) with a minimum monoester content (90%) are mixtures of positional isomers of the monoester and propane-1,2-diol diesters and have mainly a mixed fatty acid profile. The typical fatty acid composition of distilled propane-1,2-diol esters is a blend of palmitic and stearic acid, which may vary from 60:40 to 30:70 in the C16:C18 ratio (Spars�, 2015).",14416,RF-00000255-ADD,"Propane-1,2-diol esters of fatty acids",complex mixtures: not derived from botanical sources,7,QU07A,as such,,"Propane-1,2-diol esters of fatty acids (E 477)",,,,14416,RF-00000255-ADD,"Propane-1,2-diol esters of fatty acids",,,,organic,,,
